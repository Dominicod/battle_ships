# Battleships

Battleship was originally a pencil-and-paper public domain game known by different names, but Milton Bradley made it into the well known board game in 1967. In this implementation of battleship we output the board to the command line and allow the user to use CLI input to interact with the game.

## Test the portfolio on your local machine

If you wish to edit or test battleship on your local machine, go ahead and run...

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Dominicod/battle_ships.git
cd battle_ships
```

From this point you will need ruby 2.7.2 installed on your local machine as well as RSpec installed if you wish to test any of your added additions to the game.

### Running the game

You will first need to navigate to the run file located in;

```shell
ruby ./lib/battleship_runner.rb
```

You will then see CLI output along the lines of;

```shell
Welcome to BATTLESHIP
-----------------------
Enter p to play. Enter q to quit
```

You can now play the game! Enjoy!

## Developing

To edit any of the files to add more features to this battle_ship program, it is recommend to make a new class file and then write your new feature there. Create a spec file as well to test your newly created file and then implement its features in either the battleship_runner.rb file or the start.rb file.

## What we learned

We learned alot about collaboration during this project. Our main method of working together was using the pairing style "Driver, Navigator" . This was extremely helpful for us as this allowed me and my partner to always be on the same page when working on this project. We also learned how to reach through objects effectively as well as reading files, ordinal values, and nested iteration.
